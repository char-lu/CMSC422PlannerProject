# CMSC422PlannerProject
In this folder there are 2 jupyter notebooks. There is also a copy of the data I collected in an excel file called blocksworld_data

domain_independent.ipynb and htn.ipynb, which contains methods to their respective planners.

In the problems directory, there are several directories each containing 10 pddl problem files, numbered according to problem size. 

For the notebooks, change the code to point to whichever problem size/problem number you wish to run.
